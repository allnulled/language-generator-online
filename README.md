# language-generator-online

Create programming languages: online, with scalability, and from mobile devices too.

## How to use it

1. Open the application here: [https://allnulled.github.io/language-generator-online/](https://allnulled.github.io/language-generator-online/).

2. Create a new **PROJECT** clicking on *[NEW PROJECT]* button. A dialog will appear. Introduce the name of the new project you want and press enter.

3. Select the recently created project. This will bring you to the **EDITOR** tab.

4. Create a new **FILE** clicking on *[NEW FILE]* button. A dialog will appear. Introduce the name of the new file you want and press enter.

5. Select the recently created file. This will make to show up the editor text box.

6. Write on the editor: `Language = "Hello world!"`.

7. Click on the *[OPTIONS]* tab, placed on top.

8. Then, click on the *[GENERATE PARSER]* button.

9. Tada!!! You can say you have created a programming language. The file that has been downloaded is the probe. If you open it, you will find the source code of your programming language, which is compatible with web environments.

## Goals

The goal of this application is to let anyone to:

- **to create programming languages**: this application is about programming languages.
- **from web environment**: the idea is to use this app as a web application.
- **for web environments**: the languages you create from here are compatible with web environments.
- **from mobile devices**: the development has in mind to be fully compatible with mobile devices.
- **with project scalability in mind**: despite your language is made by 1 piece of code, you can split it by any number of parts, for you to easily organize yourself.
- **as a true environment**: the application remembers its own state thanks to `localStorage`. This means that, if you use the application from a device, that device will remember how was the application left the next time you get into it again. This way, you can stop and retake your development at the same point it was left, which simulates a true environment, with "files" that are saved automatically.

Soon, a *tester* tab will be introduced, in order to be able to test your own programming languages from this application too.
